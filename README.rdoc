You shoud manually include MagnificPopup in you main project.
Recommended way is to use Rails Assets.

 1.  gem 'discourse_static_assets'
     in Gemfile

 2. //= require 'discourse_static_assets'
    in app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss

 3. //= require 'discourse_static_assets'
    in app/assets/javascripts/application.coffee
